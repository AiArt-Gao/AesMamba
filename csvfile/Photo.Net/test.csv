It certainly has something about it that makes you study it for a long while. I dont think the intent was to give it a living dead feel to it (the title seems to suggest that not) even though that was my first impression when I saw it. Then again, I have to get this horror movie mentality out of my head before I can truly judge this photo. The heavy eyelid raises many questions: is this person sick and cant feel the vigor of life? Is he/she under the influence of drugs and has his/her body and mind become desensitized? Is this someone who suffers from depression and needs a caring touch, a bit of outside help to get him/her out of her depression? The title has a good theme to it and even though I would have instead preferred FEEL, I think that touch makes us see the photo under a different light. Whereas feel would suggest an emotional situation, touch suggests a physical condition, be it a need for personal physical contact, a need for human communication or a restriction to the person such as being confined to some sort of prison or situation. Is this person terminally ill and is at the brink of passing to the after life? That would be a perfect time to feel the touch of another human being..preferably one of a close family member.

Maybe a flash can improve it. \r\n', 'classic snow scene where the white is bluish because you didnt compensate your exposure. White fools your camera meter because it is too bright, therfore insted of using a flash as mentioned before under-expose the shot by 1 stop or so or if your meter says to shoot 1/250th @ F11 shoot 1/500th @ F11, the white will be much whiter.

To get yer whites whiter, you have to overexpose, not underexpose.  Think about how much light is hitting the film.  More light (overexposing) equals darker negative (or lighter positive) and a lighter resulting print.  Besides, I agree with the previous poster, that a fill flash would have been fine here.  You get the beautifully exposed sky behind it that way.  The picture is taken from shadow, and you can either accept the blue cast for the way the scene is, or compensate somehow.  Overexposing to bring out the detail in the highlights would wash out the sky, losing some of the colour contrasts.  (I'm British, hence the extra U..) A fill flash would have let you expose for the sky, and lift the ice a tone or two.\r\n"", ""I'm not so concerned with the blue snow. To me the problem here is the underexposed climber.

I was just returning from having seen, both in this site and in ""real world"" exhibitions, a considerable number of images in which the photographer had staged up some action, usually involving himself, and had shot the whole. Unfortunately, images of this kind usually involve some symbolism, and attempt to convey some meaning, which I am too lazy, or too dense, to decipher. They simply appear too concocted and artificial to me. I have the old fashioned opinion that the main purpose of photography should be to show some, more or less hidden, aspects of reality rather than staging situations. There are other arts for this. Of course, this is subjective and questionabe, but that\'s it.

Of course, not everyone likes the pictures nor my approach, but then we need this diversity, or life would be very boring. What admittedly does suprise me sometimes is the persons that take the trouble to look at a photo and then rate it angrily with a 1/1 or a 2/2 (or an awful mail to me!). I sometimes look up their file to see just what it is that they like themselves and, more often than not, it is people that have not posted any pictures at all. Their average ratings overall are also very low too, which makes me wonder, once again, why they go to all this trouble?  anyway, I haven\'t really figured this one out yet! I guess the models are pretty yes. I\'m going to hate myself for saying this, but you can\'t make a good tomato sauce without starting out with good tomatoes! After all, I have chosen to do ""glamour photography"", and there can be no hypocrisy about that. Where do they come from? Well, they are all friends or girls that I meet (that certainly become friends too after the sessions). We all meet attractive people, the challenge is to get them to agree to pose.  Anyway, I\'m very grateful to these wonderful young ladies that put their trust in us and allow us to share in their beauty. Now as to Oliver\'s remark regarding the creation of ""eye catching images"", but yes, that is precisely what I am trying to do! I have no other pretensions on the subject than that. Can that not be an objective in itself? Obviously there are two different approaches in my portofolios, first of all the photographs, which must be judged on their own merit, and then the fun that has been had in trying out different compositions with the computer. I am not trying to substitute one from the other, I am just trying to see what more or less (hopefully) attractive images one can end up with through manipulation. That\'s all. I cannot draw or paint, but I do enjoy pushing shapes and colours around. The Warlow-esk type pictures are just a fun thing also. It is just an attempt to try something a little different. Some people like them others don\'t!  Again, of course I understand that. Admittedly, you do sometimes end up with a picture however which gets much more, and a longer-lasting attention, than the original photo would have done on its own. Is that an accomplishment or not? I don\'t know. I think it depends on the person looking at the result. Actually, some of these manipulated photos do make attractive pictures when framed on the wall where they can be very decorative.  This is particualrly so in those compositions where the models are no longer recognisable. Many of them have put them up in their homes and it has become a kind of on-going joke. Hey it looks like you .. Oh really, come on now! Lastly, I should say that I have the greatest respect for the purists. I wish I could emulate them more, but frankly I\'m not very good on the technical side. I just do things according to my own means, with a camera and a flash .. and then of course the computer. And most of all,  of course,  I try to have some fun.\r\n', 'I feel like Im right there..\r\n', 'John - I\'ve also experienced those ""persons that take the trouble to look at a photo and then rate it angrily with a 1/1 or a 2/2"" as you noted above. Recently some folks did that to a couple of perfectly innocent, not that unattractive photos I\'d posted. My initial reaction was to look at their folders and denounce their efforts with absurd ratings. So I did. But then I got to thinking that wasn\'t such a great approach, so I\'ve sworn it off and will only rate with kindness in the future! Besides, in the uncalled for low ratings incidents I refer to, I noticed that the people involved all had names I would associate with people living in non-English speaking countries. Maybe - just maybe - a language barrier allowed these folks to think that ""1"" was the top rating and in fact they just loved what they saw. After all- being Number 1 is usually a good distinction to own! \r\n', 'John, this is a favorite image for me, too. The eyes look tentative yet trusting. I have noticed in quickly scanning your work that the models all seem relaxed and trusting. This is no small feat: you must have an honorable and disarming nature.\r\n', ""Thanks Peter, I truly appreciate this remark. A trusting relationship is everything in this kind of photography.

I\'ve seen this response routinely at photo.net and photosig.com and I\'ve seen it in a couple of your posts. It\'s perfectly valid for someone to critique a photo without having posted anything. Perhaps they don\'t own a scanner, maybe they\'re just not interested in having their work reviewed, or maybe they\'re just new and haven\'t bothered yet. Either way, that doesn\'t invalidate the opinon. You\'ve posted the photo for review, so accept what\'s offered. As for overall ratings, they should average out to about average (around four). If I didn\'t skip all the snapshots people post of the their cats and dogs, my average rating would probably be less than two in both categories.   Next, back to the photo at hand..  It\'s very nice. She\'s very attractive and that certainly helps. The combination of the rather submissive pose, the lighting, and expression give her a very innocent appeal. My only complaints are that the far arm looks like it\'s missing and, whether intentional or not, the lack of sharpness on her breast looks like a mistake to me. The crop revealing one breast but not the other creates a definite visual tension for me, but I honestly can\'t say whether that tension adds or detracts from the image.   If you set aside my comparatively unimportant technical complaints, you\'re left with an image that appears to have drawn out a great deal of the model\'s personality and certainly evokes a lot of emotion in the viewer. There\'s also a definite duality to the expression. She looks youthful and innocent, but there\'s an undertone of desire there, and the strong eye contact really draws you into the image. It\'s very compelling and it gets better the longer you look at it. \r\n', ""Hy Joe. Thank you for your comment and for your assessment of my photo which I find both well balanced and very useful.

You have been around on these sites long enough to know that those that do this rarely have at heart the qualities of a photo. They are venting their frustrations at their own inadequacies and they hide behind their false identities in order to do it. Look at the brilliant and exceptional work that Anna Pagnaco shows us, and the disgusting comments that it sometimes arouses. I guess that in any cross section of the society, you will have to deal with some morons too. I'm simply passed the stage where I don't tell them what I think they are, only I don't do it anonymously. \r\n"", ""..those that do this rarely have at heart the qualities of a photo..  That is quite correct. There's no doubt that many of the low raters are either revenge rating or just seem to get a kick out of handing out 1s.

Yeah, if you want to do stock photography! It would be hilarious if it wasn\'t so aggravating. Most of the photos on this site are wither horribly unoriginal or just horrible. Between getting 1 ratings from mysterions with names similar to famous photographers who have posted no photos, to being accosted by hacks for not following their rules of photography, I am just about to give up on this hackfest and move on.

Sometimes, when one is alone, one begins to doubt and feel defensive about being stubborn and persuing a certain approach, when all the ""experts"" tell you are wrong. In my early days here, when I really didn\'t know very much, there was one of these truly brilliant photographers on this site who I respect   who was telling me after every posting that everything I did was wrong! He was analysing my photos with a scalpel,  pointing out the faults. I looked at his portfolio and understood that I could never achieve the excellence that he had done, which made me even more depressed! I know he meant well, and I agreed with almost all  his comments,  but I remain nevertheless convinced today that he is wrong in substance. If we are to make a contribution as individuals, however modest it may be, we must also try sometimes to break some rules so as to offer something different. If this is done in a haphazard way, it is a waste of time, but if one shows consistently and tries to underline, as I have done,  what is natural and spontaneous in one\'s subjects, then maybe one can look beyond the technical precision that is required of a different kind of work? Many people seem to have understood now that the nudity is superfuous in my photography. It is a means to an end, and never, almost never a goal in itself. Part of the reason that I get so many girls to pose for me is that I explain to them what my objectives are. they are intrigued by the challenge of revealing themselves as they really are.  Strangely, they have become to a large extent my strongest supporters. 9/10ths of them would have never responded to an invitation tosimply  ""remove their clothes and pose"". However, following them around the apartment with a camera and a glass of wine allows me to pass from being an intruder to an accomplice.  Looking back on the pictures I took as a schoolboy (the children I have posted here) I realise that my approach to photography was the same even then.

Seriously, though, I appreciate your visit and comment. Regarding the contrast, I would be interested in knowing on what kind of monitor you are viewing this on. At home, I have a CRT that I calibrated and profiled with my Eye1 colorimeter just prior to the workup of this image. I am fairly happy with the gamma level in the midground. At the office I have an LCD and the gamma is probably a good 0.2 point higher, not to mention a much higher luminance value; the resultant image contrast looks awful on that monitor. Well, awful may be too strong, but it is at least not as I intended it to look. For example, at home I have good definition throughout the sky, but at the office the extreme highlight in the upper right quadrant is blowing out. I may make a trial Chromira print of this and that will be the proof of the pudding, so to say. Now, I want you to promise me to come back here in two weeks so that you may properly correct your rating to that well deserved 7/7!

But here I am, at home, looking at this again on my monitor and I can't really bring myself to do that. I like the subtle midground contrast level. But as a test, I will aquiesce and try the suggested S-curve in the accompanying attachment.

I normally spend all my time in representation, but here ventured into expression, to use your terms.  I\'m glad you liked the result.  Xiang, your stairway with the red-clad climbers (Study of Curves, Color and Motion, I believe is what it is called) is one of the defining photographs on PN for me.  I think I go to that shot at least once a month.  I put it in the same category as Colin Carron\'s shot of the crossing at Ely Cathedral, which I consider masterful).

In fact, I shouldn\'t be surprised if it takes a turn in the Top 3 folder soon, replacing the Chauriat shot.  Do you owe Jack a royalty on the use of ""superb""?  Joseph, the POV is very hard for me in cloisters, as a rule.  PJ uses a long lens to terrific effect .. she gets this wonderful sense of compression and repetition and rhythm that I can\'t capture with my wide angle.

Came home after our conversation on the phone today and started work on this immediately.  You do like the atmospheric shots that play to your keen sense of memory and of mystery.  Pascal, omigod, he used the ""g"" word.  Pascal, one reason that you are my good friend, and one reason that I admire you so much is that you wear your heart on your sleeve.  You have strong feelings and you are never afraid to express them.  Sometimes you go back and edit yourself (you have certainly set the PN record for the most bios :) but you do express those thoughts and emotions that move you.  That is powerful and I treasure it.

I know it is the title of Follett's book; but the emphasis in this photograph are the pillars, the columns, made of rock; rock from the earth. The light is amazing as it slips through the gaps in the columns and illuminates the flagstones. Could the Empress Maude, or Harry her son, or Eleanor of Aquitaine have seen this?  I think yes.

The light is flowing heavily around them and proclaiming itself.  I like the triangular nature of the composition, pulling the eye in toward the dark recess in the back.  I love the floor in particular with the dappled light mixing with the details in stone.\r\n', '.. I love Pascal\'s rants.  I\'m thinking about publishing a book of his bios :)  PJ warned that it would be like War and Peace, it would be so long!  Chris, believe it or not, I just read the book about a month ago for the first time.  PJ had read it years ago and dug it out for me.  Fontenay was one of the monasteries founded by the great Bernard of Clairvaux.  He put them in the ""wilderness"" far away from temporal temptations.  As a result, they are so peaceful and calming, sheltering.  That is the feeling I tried to get here.  Pierre, are you still lashed to the mast listening to your personal siren?  It is hard for me to picture you any other way :)  I\'ve decided that you don\'t terminate your HTML code so that you can find your path back through the labyrinth of Photonet!

What a wonderful writer, to be able to capture that picture in words so exactly.  He perfectly described something so visual.""  She asked me to tell you that she admires your ability to do that.\r\n', ""Yes, Jeff is right, without the arched ceiling light at the top right, this picture would be 2 dimensional, it's a vital part. What I talked about and deleted was about the old Ilford 25 asa I used when digital did not exist because of its tremendous fine detail it could capture , almost like having a large format resolution in 24x36. One of the problem of that film though was its craving for light,m especially interiors. So lots of films would come out almost transparent which meant that they let all the light through and created an effect of light being eaten by the dark. I think that the dark rather than the light is what is thick as syrup, almost as when you turn a positive into a negative. It turns a flaw into a strenght,creates a very special atmosphere which is perfectly captured. But what I love about this picture more than the special effects (which are great by themselves) is the lack of extraneous elements..there is a Roman Cloister which also obeys the law of aesthetic of the best Japanese building and also would satisfy Mosque sobriety..It excels by its lack of anything which would compromise its perfection. You know, as if you take a picture with lots of stuff and you take pieces one at the time until only the absolute essence of it is left, as grenouille extracts the perfect perfume out of women, Dennis extracted the essence of the place and put it into a picture (well without killing anyone of course)\r\n"", 'Very good composition which drives my eye along thr cloister. I like the depth and the superb light.IMO, the B&W brings some mysticism into the image. I feel like I could hear the noise of the silence.\r\n', ""Hi Dennis, nearly missed your question. Yes, I've uploaded Saint Sulpice, thanks for your advice on it.\r\n"", 'Very unusual to say the least, the columns upper parts looks like human heads..I looked a long time to see where the light is coming from and how it ""engraved"" the line of "" human  statues""..  It is a masterpiece of your art within a given art Dennis,  the thick shadow and crawling light to the inside is beautifuly  observed. The place with the arced end  has a mysterious feeling.. \r\n', ""Great Photo, I really get the feeling that the light is trying to break through this impenetrable line of pillars. It's like a battle of light VS darkness..a really powerful image to me.\r\n"", '.. some great discussion going on around this photo, one which I almost didn\'t even post :)  Pascal, your line ""It excels by its lack of anything which would compromise its perfection.""  That is perfection itself.  In is a reductio on my reductio and encapsulates perfectly something I believe is at the very heart of true art.  Your observation about the dark flowing .. I get that same sense, as if it is retreating before the light.  And the Ilford discussion, which you probably deleted earlier, is a wonderful way to capture your thoughts.  No need ever to edit on my account.  Armindo, that silence is something we cannot even imagine in our lives.  From the way you shoot the images in your portfolio, I believe that you seek those quiet moments, that solitude, in the midst of the other world.  Your shots are of a single figure in a landscape, a couple in the distance on an othewise empty beach,  empty vistas of water, of land, a fisherman isolated against the sea.  Almost never do I see two people in one of your shots, and if they are there (like the umbrella couple), they are isolated from everyone else.  I hope that this is not loneliness on your part, but the desire for solitude and silence.  As such, I thank you for recognizing that quality in this shot.  Ton, thanks for uploading the shot, see it now, will run off and look at what you did with it.    Pnina, ""thick shadow and crawling light"". And you say that you have problems with your English!  Thank you for the wonderful compliment.  Tim, such a great metaphor, the battle between light and dark, because of course that is what it was in reality, that is how they saw their struggle; the battle between ignorance and knowledge, good and evil, light and dark.  \r\n']",0   0   0   0   9  10   3,5.7272727272727275,2

This is the kind of HDR image that I personaly hate as it looks just awful to me ! Colour saturation is completely over the top (especially water and the sky part).  I had a look at your other photo, of the same location  which looks much more natural.  By the way - I read in one of your comment that you're just taking one exposure and develop it later with 3 different exposure settings. Well - it's not really a true dynamic range increase as you are still using one exposure and simply forcing it to capture more details. It may work fine for sunset shots (where contrast within the scene is not so huge) but you'll get much better results when taking a bracketed sequence (i.e. -2, 0, +2EV).

Coming back to digital manipulation techniques. For a coastal shots I would probably advice you DRI technique instead of pure HDR one.   The main difference between these two techniques is that HDR image is generated automatically pixel by pixel from all the available data. It can be really good for certain situations, but since it's not easy to control the whole process, the results are often very poor.  DRI (Dynamic Range Increase) is a simple manual technique, where you use a few differently exposed photos and blend them together (using layers and masks in PS). It requires a lot of patience and precision, but results are usually much more natural since you have absolute control over the whole process.

Cheers\r\n"", ""Josh--Thanks for you input. I definitely see what you are saying. To be honest, this was a snapshot location when I was traveling so I'm pleased I got anything even this nice. I will definitely be visiting it again in the future. What you can't see right here is that I'm standing on a slippery rock in my suede shoes in the dead of winter when it was so cold I could barely press the shutter release! I plan to head back during the summer when I can get in the water and set up exactly how I want. Getting closer to the falls would be tough--even this far away the spray was so bad that I only got a couple pictures that weren't completely ruined by water spots on my lens. I definitely like the idea of getting lower and focusing on the foreground and will do that. I didn't whip out the telephoto because I was in a hurry but would also love to do that to isolate the bigger falls. Also, the area above the large fall was so bright (probably about 6 or 7 stops) that it was nearly impossible to get a decent exposure with the opening above the falls included. Thanks again for your input and thoughts--thoughtful critiques are always helpful, regardless of whether or not I agree (and I do agree with you for the most part). Take a look at the same folder this image came from, there are several other compositions that may be closer to what you have in mind.\r\n"", ""While I agree, in the main, with Josh's excellent critique; I think that there's another option for this shot too. First, let me say that this is your best effort of the bunch for this particular waterfall. I like this a lot! For this image, you might try and crop up from the bottom to just below the little riffle in the foreground; leaving about one-half of the longer diagonal red rock on the left. This gives the illusion of the water pouring out of the bottom. It makes a nearly square format, but seems to balance the centered main fall. When you go back, be careful and try and eliminate that patch of empty sky to the left of the top of the fall; it will always be an exposure issue. It looks like a shift to the left side might take care of that. Keep up the good work, Tyler; your work is really looking great these days. Cheers! Chris\r\n"", 'The shadows around falls do much to obscure the rocks and diminish depth of scene there.  Water is too dark preventing good visual of foreground and area up to base of falls.  Good you cropped part of boulder on right.  My sense is this would be better if 3 shots were taken and stitched: falls, middle area up to base of falls and foreground; each with their respective exposures.  I have uploaded a version (and much better than the last one I made of this).  \r\n', ""Chris--Thanks for the suggestions and comments. As you know, I value your opinion and appreciate you helping me improve.  Frank--I feel very fortunate to have you follow some of my work and offer your suggestions. I admire your work tremendously and your critiques are priceless. You are always hold no punches when evaluating work which some may not like but I love. It's helpful to know when someone admires your work, but even more helpful when someone as respected and expert as yourself tells you how the image could be improved. So, thanks for this and all your many comments. With that said, your edit of this shot is one of the best I've seen. You made tremendous improvements. I shot it with a polarizer and the only thing I did was to add some saturation. What you did made the scene much closer to how it really appeared--it looks like a fall in the middle of winter in your edit. If you don't mind, would you please share a couple details about how you did that? I'm still playing with PS and (very) slowly learning how to improve my work. Once again, thanks for your interest in my work and your dedication to helping me improve--it is much appreciated!\r\n"", ""My first impression here is three separate shots to be photo merged. Also, if you can ALWAYS shot RAW images; jpegs are compressed and degrade each time you open or edit them.  In RAW mode you have exactly what your digital sensor captured, a kind of digital negative, with much more post processing potential.  Ok, for this image use photo shop; create a copy of this as a background layer; go to image->adjustments-> shadow and highlight; play around on the background layer copy with the shadow and highlight sliders; find what you like and blend the layer with background.  Also, I would save the saturation until after you have the tonal corrections completed; I think that may be a problem with the reds in the rocks in the river restricting tonal range.  Here I did some simple tonal contrast adjustments and a high pass filter sharpen, 4.5px hard light blended at 40% opacity, which helps with depth and highlight contrast.  Since the image was an edited jpeg, I could not retrieve original tonality, but was able to get some back.   You can also use selective levels and curves, which automatically create adjustment layers; rocks around falls is a good place for that technique -- don't do no stinking dodging there.\r\n"", ""Frank--Thanks again! As always, your responses are most helpful! Just so you know, I always shoot in RAW and always bracket my exposures, generally pretty widely. For this shot, I have 4 stops total of bracketing (this is the middle, camera metered exposure). Although I don't know everything about photoshop yet, I'm thinking ahead and bracketing everything so when I do learn more, I have the RAW files to go back to and do my blending.

Its refreshing to read an honest and carefully worded critique. I have carefully considered your opinion and come to a conclusion by referring back to the original image. To my surprise the right side markings such as hairs and wing veins were actually very close to identical. However the right wing was a few millimetres lower than the left and the right feet were about 2 millimetres forward and lower of their current position. It is for those reasons only that I cloned the image. The reason that I have submitted the shot this way is because I wanted to express the fly as a piece of art rather than a documentary but most importantly I wanted the viewer's eye to be isolated from distraction, which I feel emphasizes the garden beast and not the garden. I thankyou for taking the time to study my image in such great detail and may I offer you a suggestion as to why I would want to intentionally create symmetry. In a matter of less than .05 of a second, humans instinctively scan a visual object for symmetrical qualities.   Perception, symmetry of art discussed at brain lecture March 22, 2002  By Elizabeth Roth  ?Not only does the mind create art, it also perceives it,? began Randy Blakely, Ph.D., Allan D. Bass Chair in Pharmacology, and director, Center for Molecular Neuroscience, in his introduction of Dr. Christopher Tyler. Tyler, of the Smith Kettlewell Eye Institute, delivered the second lecture in the 2002 Brain Awareness program recently at the Frist Center for the Visual Arts.   Tyler discussed how the brain perceives symmetry and how artists, consciously or unconsciously, create their art based on an understanding of symmetrical principles.   Symmetry is a key visual property for humans. Its importance is expressed in its ubiquitous use as a design principle in everything humans construct, from architecture to the pattern in Oriental rugs.   Defined as balanced form, a beauty of form arising from balanced proportions, it is no surprise, then, that elements of symmetry are apparent in works of art. But, it is only partial symmetry that we see. In many of the Renaissance works Tyler presented, architectural elements of a painting were symmetrical while figures in the foreground were arrayed. Similar examples from other eras and artistic styles were presented as well.   Perhaps, it was theorized, that artists were unconsciously using symmetry to represent order, harmony, or serenity while the asymmetrical elements depicted that life and art are not perfect and therefore, cannot be perfectly symmetrical.   Through functional magnetic resonance imaging, it is clear that the brain reacts to symmetry in the occipital lobe, the primary part of the brain that reacts to visual stimuli. Tyler?s research indicates that human symmetry processing is hard-wired. In a matter of less than .05 of a second, humans instinctively scan a visual object for symmetrical qualities.   Questions were raised during the lecture about an evolutionary bias toward symmetry, possibly due to the fact that symmetrical bodies, biologically speaking, seem to be the best designed for procreation. Studies have shown that those human faces that are widely considered to be the most attractive are also quite symmetrical. Is this equivocation of symmetry to beauty, as was asked during the lecture, why humans very often tilt their head to one side as they speak directly to someone, or they stand with one foot forward, at an angle, perhaps in an attempt to mask any asymmetry? Could this explain the subconscious attention to symmetry in so many works of art?? Could this explain the subconscious attention to symmetry in so many works of art?   Symmetrical elements are often found in artistic works, and specifically paintings throughout many eras. Tyler noted that one of the clues to the importance of symmetry is evident in the placement of eyes in painted portraits.   According to Tyler, a survey of portraits over the last two millennia revealed that throughout history, one eye tended to be placed symmetrically at or near the vertical axis of the canvas. This placement violates the inherent symmetry of the face and body, but expresses a deeper symmetry and concentration on the ?window on the soul.? Perhaps the artists felt it was more accurate to represent their subjects in their realistic imperfection.   Interestingly, Tyler found this theme to be present in diverse works from various cultures. Despite Tyler?s extensive research, he indicated that he was unable to find any reference to this principle, leaving him to conclude that the artists were not purposefully centring eyes in their portraits, but rather, did so unconsciously. \r\n"", ""Wow! ..er! ..

From a technical perspective, I think the model works well here.  Skin tone is even, texture smooth, features symmetrical.  This is important in figure photography.  Interaction of texture and shape (i.e., anatomy) with light is pretty central to figure photography, so symmetry of her breasts is very much an artistic element here.  I\'ve seen a couple of your other shots of this model, and I think this one (unlike many of your others) has a good feel for the artistic demands on the model.  Now for a few things I don\'t like.  Hope you take these comments in the constructive sense in which they\'re intended.  I\'d lose the border -- IMHO, it doesn\'t add anything artistically, and it\'s distracting.  Lighting\'s a little flat.  A reflector might have helped fill shadow area in the left eye.  Catchlight in the eyes would have improved the impact of this shot -- perhaps had she turned her gaze a little higher, and/or had you used a bounce card on your flash.  Doesn\'t appear that you\'ve achieved critical focus here.  She has beautiful eyes -- you owe it to the model to get them in tack-sharp focus.  Compositionally, I find this photo to be lacking in dynamism, and I\'m sorry to say that this is a general comment I have about many of your portraits.  I\'d go for a tighter crop, just below the breast, and move her left eye into the rule-of-thirds critical vertex in the top right of the composition.  You should work more with this model.  One thing that puzzles me is your use of an 80-200/2.8 zoom.  Portraiture is intimate, giant zooms are not.  For this work, you\'d be better served with the Leica and the 50mm/2 -- much more conducive to establishing that intimate relationship between the photographer and the model.  Also, I\'d lose the Kodak Gold -- it\'s got miserably high contrast and a garish color palette.  I find that Supra works much better, and Portra (Kodak) or NPS (Fuji) work better still.  Hope you won\'t mind a few general comments on portraiture and figure photography.  It\'s not clear to me what your artistic vision is, other than from your posted bio: ""I\'m a Ph.D., and my models have gone to graduate school..""  Your attempt to use nudity as a means to reveal their human frailty seems to fall pretty close to flat, for me at least.  The nudity in many of these shots seems totally gratuitous and does not help convey any sense of artistic vision.  Taking one\'s shirt off and getting one\'s picture taken doesn\'t make it glamour.  That said, I think there remain ~many~ of your shots that show promise.  Get a less obtrusive lens (i.e., a good prime, maybe 80 to 100mm) and a lower-contrast emulsion, pay attention to technical execution (esp. critical focus and lighting), and concentrate on building a relationship with one or two models.  The one in this shot should definitely be one of them.\r\n', 'The point  made in the biliography that you refer to is simply that like many of us, I lead a very demanding life, and my photography takes on more significance because of it. What is not irrelevant however is what you call the ""graduate"" status of some of the models, and that is where I feel that my message cannot or does not want to get across to you.  I went back to read it again and it seems quite clear enough to me. But then, everyone cannot identify with the same things. You say that you find the nudity gratuitous, but I made the point that nudity has a purpose here in that it is meant to capture the contrast in these girls lives, the seriousness on one side and their femininity on the other. Many have understood this, others pretend not to. Of course, still others will be vexed by it, but you can\'t please everyone. Of course, I can let people just look at the photos and judge their worth per se. But then the rational behind them would be absent, and to me and, most of all, to the girls themselves, it has a meaning.  What you refer to as a lack of vision on my part is somewhat disconcerting coming from someone who has posted none of his own work and whose own vision, if he has one, it is impossible to compare with! Whereas I often do agree with people\'s critics, it is difficult to understand where the ""expertise"" they value so much comes from, if they never show us any of their own work, or only dare to do so under a different name from that with which they make their more cynical comments to others. How brave!  Glamour photography and the development of the ""special relation with the model"" (which you obviously cite from one of my own comments, not your own resources) is not something within the reach of everyone, and I would really like to know also how you speak with such authority on this?  As regards your artistic critic of this photo, I agree  with some of the points you raise. I will repeat once again that other than in some of my black and white nudes, these pictures are not an attempt to capture the ""perfect"" photo (which I would be incapable of doing anyway), so much as to capture a candid moment in their lives. As I said, some may find this interesting, others not. Others still will resent the attention that such photos get, because they do not get such attention themselves, despite all their efforts to ""perfect"" their work. We have some superb technicians on this site, whose work can be analysed in great detail. I have nothing to contribute in this area. That does not mean that my photos cannot be improved though, and I thank you for taking so much trouble going over this one. In all frankness though,as you well know,  it was just a snapshot taken on the balcony after a swim! There are possibly one or two other more interesting photos posted that you may have considered for such a ""specialist\'s"" attention as your own, but then maybe you chose this one on purpose. Oh, just one last word .. my use of the long focal lens.  Well, that\'s my technique. By what possible reasoning does someone tell me that I should do things in their way (or, rather, how they would ""imagine"" they would do it)?! If I did, then maybe my photos would look more like theirs too, and then what would I have less to contribute, unless your premise is of course that I don\'t?!  In conclusion Bill, you make a  lot of biting and sarcastic remarks, albeit occasionally  accompanied by a rather weak  attempt at pretending ro make a compliment. I don\'t know what the problem is, but I don\'t feel that it\'s in this photo! Possibly, your true assessment of my work was written earlier by you here, in a less hypocritical manner ..  http://ww.photo.net/photodb/photo.tcl?photo_id=598149  .. where your remark is more revealing as to the true reason for writing your comment.  .. The statement was removed following this posting, but I happen to have registered it!! .. It was as follows:  ""I\'ve seen Peri\'s work -- he seems to think that if it\'s shirtless, it\'s art. His style seems to be to get the woman out of her clothes, snap away haphazardly with an obtrusive zoom, and damn the technical details like lighting, composition, and critical focus. The only thing that seems to be missing is the instructions to the model to ""Say Cheese!"".  .. Well, I hope that I have been equally candid and straightforward as you in my reply. As I implied earlier, you have a chip on your shoulder sir, but the problem  is quite obviously with yourself, and not with my photography or my models! \r\n', ""Honesty from an amateur: I like the looks of the photo, the tilt of her head,her eyes looking down, the hair in her face, the arms reaching out, holding? a towel? You did a great job with a candid shot, it wasn't setup or staged.I think it is a great shot overall.   I don't like the frame, sorry, just doesn't seem to fit and I think the lighting is a little flat. Thats it.. C= 7 A = 8\r\n"", 'I like this portrait, I like the pose, and I like the framing. I like this portrait even more when I consider that John is not a professional photographer (glamour or otherwise). Maybe this quality of work is easy when one has a dedicated studio with opportunities on a daily basis to refine skill and technique. On the other hand, perhaps its not so easy, because (in my opinion) the majority of the portraits posted here do not reach John\'s level.   I disagree with Bill\'s criticism of this portrait and John\'s other portraits and technique. Why be critical of using an 80-200mm zoom? This lense allows a great deal of flexibility and it allows a comfortable working distance between the photographer and the model who may not want someone with a 50mm lens getting as close as would be necessary to use same for this shot.   Gratuitous nudity?  I disagree.  One can see more nudity than is in this portrait on Fox or any other ""free"" channel any evening of the week.    Portrait photography, especially glamour photography, is hard work, especially for the hobbiest who does not have a full time studio and daily opportunities to photograph. One should be slow in dispensing criticism on what a photographer should have done, choice of lens selection, technique, etc. if the critic has not posted his own work on this site for critical review.   John, thanks for the excellent work and thanks for inspiring us other non-professional photographers to keep working at it.   Greg\r\n', 'You said ""Rob, it\'s the models that are a little touchy over this .. and I do understand them. In getting them to agree to pose and be published, I insisted on the very academic manner in which their photos will be examined.. not their anatomy!""   While I agree with this in principle, I think the original comment is legit. Part of the reason this photo works is that she has very nice hair and breasts. Neither you nor the model may appreciate the rather raw sexual nature of this opinion, but the results are what they are. There\'s a strong sexual appeal in the photo that\'s reinforced by her breathless expression, and her breasts and generally athletic figure are an undeniable part of that appeal. The lack of eye contact invites the viewer to study her figure, further adding to the sexuality of the image. Compare this image to JF F461 in the same folder (Photo.net id 776792, immediately to the right of this photo in the gallery) and ask yourself if this photo works with the hair or breasts from that image. That photo works also, but you can\'t interchange the parts. I\'m sorry to be so direct about this but it seems like the quality of a woman\'s figure is a legitimate topic in a discussion of a nude photo. I assume that as a photographer, you\'ve posted this to determine whether or not it appeals to people and why, and to find out how to improve it. These qualities are factors in the answer and can\'t be ignored because they might be prurient.   Put another way, you could say that if a woman is not comfortable with the idea of people discussing her anatomy, she might want to reconsider the idea of modeling nude.   As for the image itself, the overall look is fabulous, but definitely has more of a glamour or classic pinup flavor than an art nude flavor. Technically, I would prefer a little more density - the colors seem a little muddy (that could just be the scan). I would also prefer more of a sharply focused look than the soft look you have here, but that\'s just me. \r\n', ""I very much like this shot as well as the models expression. I agree that future images could  be improved if you were more receptive to constructive critiques. Obviously a little history there but over all I agree with Bill with the possible exception of the lense, while perhaps a shorter lense may produce better results, I think longer lenses don't invade the models space. As far as someone who doesn't have photos posted crtiqueing others works.. so what. I think it's obvious Bill knows something about photography even if he has never picked up a camera. And yes there is a part of me that wants to hear Great image I honestly want to hear whats wrong and what can I do to improve the quailty of my work much more. You are far better than I am, at least for now, lol, does that mean I should only critigue those I think I am superior to? Any Way I do like most of your work, Have fun and keep growing. Who knows you might just quit the day job\r\n"", 'I appreciate your remark Joe, which is undoubtedly well meant. However, the issue raised on this page is whether we are here to critic each others photos or the models. It is a sterile subject to which any rational person and especially a photographer can only propose a single answer.  And this has nothing to do with the rather silly contention that I don\'t like criticism. It\'s the only reason why I post my pictures here, even if I have to plow through some nonsense from time to time in order to get to it. I like the two photos that you have posted under your name. I think  that you would like it less however if I then went on to add that the model, which happens to be your wife, .. (one of my models may be mine too) ..  has a nice ass!  As for the photo above, she had her shower, she was standing in the doorway drying her hair in the sun and I snapped the photo. Anyone who attempts to analyze it more profoundly certainly has more artistic vision than me!  You say that you like this photo and the model\'s expression, but you add that this and others could be improved, however without saying how .. where is the constructive criticism in this case?!  That being said, some people will inevitably ""identify"" with Bill, and you have every right to be one of them, though not many seem to have done so on this site as ""obviously"" as you state . ..

Best wishes,  John\r\n', 'So, I promised to answer your question!  I guess that whatever I say, some people will relate to it and others not, whereas others still may search for hidden meanings which are not there  not consciously at any rate!.  Some will go further and find fault with what I say, but thats normal I suppose.  Do you know that someone even wrote to me that my biography was offensive and insulting!?  I still havent understood that one! In this regard however, and being rather new to the net (at the time of writing this), I must say I have been surprised sometimes by the number of emotions that are expressed on-line, ranging from generosity, kindness, humility, to the other extremes where people cannot restrain their feelings of anger and disdain.  All this centred anonymously around a few photos, its really quite amazing! First of all, let me begin by the end. You speak of mine and the models obvious pleasure in showing off these pictures.  I dont really think that is the issue, whether it concerns myself or them, but I will address it.   As regards my own sentiments, my pleasure in showing the pictures on this site is focussed on the feedback that I receive, which has allowed me to assess for the first time what is pleasing or not to a wide range of other people. I am actually surprised sometimes by the result.  Many of my favourite pictures, including those that have been published occasionally have remained totally ignored, whereas others which I have sometimes posted almost as an afterthought, sometimes get good reviews! Beyond this, my satisfaction has centred mainly  around the very special and privileged relationship that I have developed and continue to share with my models since I took their  photos.  It is like a special bond which only intimacy and trust can develop.  What has been shared together at these moments however is very private and cannot be described to others.  Others may only look at the result and draw their own conclusions.  My photos are often badly taken, with insufficient care for technical considerations.  Thats quite simply my style (or incompetence)!  However, you may agree that they sometimes succeed in capturing a glimpse of the charisma that all these girls possess, which is my principle objective.  Why the nudity?  Simply because I want them to reveal a part of themselves that they never have before. In this respect,  the nudity is a means to an end but it never is a goal in itself.  The girls understand this, and they accept to take up the challenge.  Why are they so often smiling or laughing?  Apart from the glass of wine obviously, its because though they are sometimes embarrassed, they are also self confident, proud and defiant.  Never are they submissive and never do I put them into a situation where they may feel even remotely so.  It is they that are in control at all times.  I feel this shows in many of the photos, but that is my interpretation.  Now comes the difficult part, which is describing what the girls feel and why.  Thats really not my job and I can only speculate on this at best. What I can do, is tell you what the girls have in common and then let you think about it on your own.  They are, in large majority well educated young ladies, with post graduate degrees or training which goes for a very special profile in self-assurance.  They are also mostly girls of a more or less privileged intellectual  background.  None of them has ever been photographed before in partial nudity, not even on the beach.  So why do they do it?  And why do they sign a publication release form, the standard joke being that they will find themselves in a book one day?  I really dont know what the reason is, but I certainly do know what it isnt.  I saw the discussion (sic!) on your portfolio Tom, and its not because the girls want any exposure of any sort.  Not only do they not need it, on the contrary, there is obviously an element of risk for them in having these photos taken.  I think its more a personal matter between the photographer and them, and also a private one between themselves.  They see my albums, they sometimes like them, I tell them they can do that too, they look at me with total disbelief .. and then they do it  -  and their girlfriends too!  Almost none of them fail to go all the way, once the commitment is taken.  Maybe Im naive, but can it simply have to do with their love of truth, of beauty, trust, friendship and complicity, and of values which are different than the materialistic, and often artificial and hypocritical ones that we have been nurtured by our surroundings into believing are so importantly the right ones?  Who knows, maybe they also read Doestoyevsky in their early years and learned that conventional things are mostly for conventional people, and that maybe some may feel that they can break the rules?  ..

It seems that many people are confused about the difference between photographs and snapshots. Here is my humble definition.  A snapshot is about the subject matter and a photograph is about painting with light.  It\'s really that simple.  Most detractors of ""nude photography"" seem not to realize that if they\'re interested in photography at all, that term, nor any other genre labels should really ever come to mind.  I don\'t think anyone would hang an Ansel Adams print on their wall because they needed that millionth glimpse of Yosemite National Park.  I\'m sure that collectors of Bresson are much more interested in the way the photographs were rendered, rather than the people in the photos. My point here is that I do not think of John\'s photographs as ""nude photography"" but simply photography.  He is a painter of light and he does it very well.\r\n', 'Hello John, and thanks for your considered response.. Regarding those who might consider your biography to contain ""offensive and insulting"" concepts, let them go.. ah, perhaps I\'ll just let that be..

I encourage you to edit at your own pleasure, and let your own aesthetics guide image and text for any future publications. The integrity of the end result will reside with you and should not be diluted by the many influences that shape opinions here. Done. Onward. My words ""obvious ..joy"" sound much different than your quote of them, which became ""obvious pleasure"" which has a decidedly hedonistic ring (smiley face goes here). If you call it pleasure, so be it (another smiley face!). I find it hard to believe that you get more reward from this forum\'s feed back than from the making of these pictures, which I perceive to be integral to your friendship with these people. I can imagine that if the internet did not exist, you would still be making these images. I recommend you follow your heart (making these images) rather than your head (analyzing them). Your satisfaction in the new and lasting relationships developed with these women rightly belongs, as you say, central to the experience. My main reason for photographing people is to know them, we are fascinating creatures of great complexity. Which brings me to this last point.. I still don\'t get it. Why these women friends of yours do this. You say you want them to reveal themselves as they never have before, but none of these women look that innocent or naive, neither do they appear to be overly extroverted or narcissitic exhibitionists. I imagine the lovers they have in their lives know this playful directness quite well, but I\'m still not sure, despite your best efforts, that I understand why they reveal it to us, the unknown thousands.

Timed and composed well, it also possesses now that kind of nostalgy peculiar to photography, (which Barth in his ""Camera Lucida"" identifies as the photography major ""punctum""). In photographing ""in the street"" as a genre there are two feature that distinguish it from other visual arts: stopped time and that we observe what happened in REAL life, its witness value. Eliminate them - and you cut both legs on which  stands (e.g. Ansel Adams so much liked in the USA does NEVER stir feelings this simple street scene so effectively creates - big unmovable objects excellently photographed in some lighting and weather are still there for anyone else to photograph in a similar way.)  Sometimes a couple of decades or more need to pass for the viewer to begin to feel that special relation to the past.   I was truly amazed when first saw collections from the 40s-60s and strived to achieve a similar effect, starting to use old cameras and b/w film and  analyzing expressive means with which old masters got so effective. So is it possible to create photographs like that now, or does one have to wait for another 50 years for today\'s mundane shots to grow patina and achieve respectability?  I do not know. So far I managed to create only one image that conveys the same poetic feeling and kind of timelessness. It completely relies on the expressive devices, ""figures of visual rhetoric"" I glimpsed from the old photographs (a whole theory I thought up trying to understand and analyze photography), but it\'s kind of  different from what this photo conveys. Probably we do not only need to photograph well, but also wait for half a life for our photographs to begin to look like precious objects..

The thing I like best about this image is the water: the ripples, the coloration, and the slight reflection of your bird. The thing that it lacks is better lighting - I don't know what time you shot this but I would guess it was sometime after 10 am. Am I right? I know a fellow photographer that will not waste his time going out if he can't be shooting in the first hour after sunrise. That is an extreme but you get the idea.

This is true for all of us - listen to what those frames are telling you.     \r\n"", ""For a fast off-hand shot, this is great!!  I also happen to like the reeds at the top and bottom since, from a nature perspective, it places the heron into its environment.  Also, the one reed crossing the bird's body would look like a real intrusion were it not for the context of the reeds.  What really makes this image, though, is the circle of th ripples.  Next time, perhaps you could ask the heron to wait a moment while you added your circular polarizer and took a bit of the glare off the water.  I think that may have improved the seeming over-exposure too.  If only birds and creatures would anticipate photographers needs!!\r\n"", ""Thanks for the thoughtful comments. I usually visit the birding sites in this area daily during the Winter, and have learned when the various breeds eat, sleep, etc. This has dictated when I shoot. This pic was taken between 3:30 and 4:00pm. The bird is facing west, which accounts for the strong sunlight from the upper left. I will work more with the polarizer and maybe reduce the exposure by 1/2 to 2/3 for similar future shots.   I think this circle is a great idea, and am glad to be included!

Also, a graduated neutral density filter might help balance the color in the reflections.

Let\'s see..   What\'s the main subject of this picture ? The bike and the ray, or rather the ray as an extension to the bike in the composition..? Am I right saying that ? If so, there\'s this rule about ""focus"", which says that an image should have 1 main subject of interest where the eye of the viewer will be called inevitably.. With the ""chatters"" in the frame, which draw a shape far brighter than the bike, visual focus goes to the chatters, away from the bike.  Clearly, at least to me, the people chatting attract the eye to the top of this image, while the eye also wants to see the bike. So, there\'s a conflict here.. With John\'s crop, we really see the bike and the ray as its extension, and the image has a start and an end. The ""faces"", to me, are too strong and telling a different story all together.  That\'s of course by the book, and it isn\'t that simple in the present case, because the crop make us loose part of the picture\'s verticality - which is why I suggest to burn the top end or to clone it rather than cropping.  You can\'t ever be blamed for not having people chatting in this shot, but you can be blamed for having a ""double focus"". In the end, I think it is all very debatable at this stage. Some will accept the ""double-focus"" because they find the ""chat"" interesting. Some, like me, will consider that the picture\'s magic has nothing to do with the chat, therefore doesn\'t need the ""chatters"",  - therefore seeing no reason to break the focus rule to add any extra element..
